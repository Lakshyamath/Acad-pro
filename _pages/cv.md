* Statistical learning: Designing a predictive function in statistical learning framework with discriminative modelling (e.g. regression) or generative modelling (e.g. multi-modality with CVAE) by minimizing a suitable loss function. Transforming a learning problem as an optimization problem.
* Optimization: First order & second order adaptive descent algorithms, interior point method for convex problems.
